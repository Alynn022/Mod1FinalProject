## Overview

This application is a version of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors that allows the users to play with Pokemon characters in place of the usual rock, paper, and scissors. In this application, the user is able to play again an AI that will randomly choose a Pokemon to battle against the user's Pokemon choice. User has the option to play two different games, a classic version and a difficult version. 

## Setup

## Challenges 
The most challenging part of this project was understanding the class to class interaction. It was intuitive to create an instance of new Player when an instance of new Game was being instantiated. But, with the given methods from the specs sheet, I believe I should have incorporated the methods for the Player in my planning more, and as I got further in the project, the harder it was for me to go back and add methods to be invoked in main.js. 

## Wins 
Overall functionality is the biggest win for me. Once I overcame the logic and functionality of the classic game, the difficult was really simple to incorporate the same logic, even with more choices and inputs for the user. Another win was getting the player's pokemon choice image to show on the battle field based on different inputs. That was most satisfying, and getting the different views to show. It really cemented that I set up the HTML sections well enough to easily change into different views. 

## Future Additions
- Add functionality for showing the user's past input and win/loss against cpu.  
- Animate a battle scene.   
- Animate the win/loss message at end of game-play.
